## Repo Description

We have built a pretty comprehensive network/RF/environmental testing/interop/EE/fabrication lab for Suborbital. It often has idle capacity in between dev cycles. We want to rent that excess capacity (and also provide a franchise revenue sharing arrangement and control plane with other folks who have lab capacity they may want to rent out).
